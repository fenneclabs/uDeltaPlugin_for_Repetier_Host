/* This is the plugin for the µDelta from eMotion Tech
 * It was originaly just a prototype in order to see if it works or not
 * but under the constraint of time we transformed it into a public version.
 * So sadly it is still a demo version, and really really rough and hardcoded!!
 * The prototype was coded in a week and I couldn't spend more time until now...
 * Please be carefull with your eyes, you may bleed.
 * 
 * 
 * I may add some features and code clarification as:
 * - Add some more comments
 * - refactoring everything, make it clear
 * - Add some configuration file for a general Delta purpose (and not just the µDelta)
 * - internationalization
 * - Some more expert mode features (as special auto-configuration, or serial-number based auto-update)
 * 
 * 
 * @Repetier: if you read this, thanks for your great work!! 
 * Plugin possibility is really really cool for any user! Please keep your host free!
